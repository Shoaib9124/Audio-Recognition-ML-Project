Audio Recognition for Gender and Age Group Classification


This repository contains the code and results for an audio recognition project aimed at classifying gender and age groups based on audio features using Machine Learning techniques.



Project Overview


The project leverages various audio feature extraction techniques such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and spectrograms to classify gender and age groups. The model is built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, trained on audio data for both classification tasks.


Features:


Gender Classification: Classifies audio samples as either Male or Female.


Age Group Classification: Classifies age into three groups: 0 for age 15 and under, 1 for age between 16 and 40, and 2 for age 41 and above.


Audio Features: MFCC, spectrogram, and other LSTM techniques for feature extraction.


Files in the Repository


Test Notebooks (ipynb): Contains Jupyter Notebook files used for training and testing the model on the audio dataset.


CSV Results: CSV files containing the results of the classification, including predictions and performance metrics.


Model Files: LSTM-based models trained for both gender and age group classification.
